Note: Targets are more complex than simple tables, as they can vary
drastically based on CYA and pH levels within the pool. Ultimately,
these should be translated into formulas for the ranges that are
dynamic based on CYA (e.g. FC levels), etc)


Recommended reading schedule:

FC	    Weekly
pH	    Weekly
TA	    Monthly
Salt	    Monthly
Stabilizer  Quarterly
Calcium	    Quarterly
